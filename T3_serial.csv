GOP Rockland County Executive Ed Day had warned over the weekend that he already had cops deployed to thwart any incoming migrants sent from the Big Apple — adding, “Mr. Adams, you can try to run us over, [and] I will reach up and grab you by the throat for the people of Rockland County.”

[Orange County Executive Steve] Neuhaus, also a Republican, revealed earlier Tuesday that Adams contacted him last week to say the city was going to pay for about 60 migrants to stay at the Crossroads Hotel in Newburgh in Orange.

Under the counties’ state-of-emergency declarations, hotels, motels and other short-term rentals in the region are prohibited from accepting asylum-seekers bused there.

Newburgh Town Supervisor Gil Piaquadio said Tuesday that town codes already prohibit hotels or motels from being used as shelters there.

“A shelter is not permitted at the Crossroads Hotel,” he said in a statement.

“The Town of Newburgh has a litany of procedures for outside governments to follow when these outside governments, like New York City, propose a use in another jurisdiction. New York City still needs to follow these procedures.”
