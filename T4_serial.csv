"3862","1782154642597568660","One way to read it:

Where there is a majority of one group against who are against immigration, they are against the expansion of all the others.

Why? Because they think the ""newcomers"" are undesirable or likely to be dependents, or to disrupt the existing order.

While where there is a minority of a group who are fine with it, they are the ones who agree that there is an existing order, and are flooding in to live off it - rather than to create or sustain it.

So Chinese & Southeast Asians are likely more interested in maintaining the existing order - even more likely to value what was a lost order in the past when they arrived. Because many of them are maybe better assimililated, more gainfully employed & economically independent, and generally more orderly.

Where just missing the majority mark, South Asians are a split community. Likely many with a 'philosophy' of ""Let's just plumb this society's 'infrastructure' for what we can get. & If we replicate what we had elswhere - and Metro Canada becomes a shithole - we can move on, or anyway we are relatively richer & less prone to the worst"".

The rest are either of this same more opportunistic mode or worse; in a sense - to be blunt - thoughtless parasitism on the Ailing Body Canada to snatch what they can, while they can. Any news that this may be unwanted will just have them conveneniently pull Karen's ""Decolonize!""

The captain of an English cargo ship has accused the French navy of 'illegally trafficking immigrant boats' across the Channel to Dover.

In damning radio messages, the angry senior officer complained to the French coastguard when his vessel, Scot Pioneer, was stopped from entering Dunkirk harbour as navy vessels, including a warship, guided the traffickers' boats around his ship.

In response, the coastguard informed him that there was an 'arrangement' between the London and Paris governments for the French navy to escort migrant boats towards Britain.

The captain begins his protest by radioing the French coastguard with the words: 'I would like to report what is an illegal operation in your waters.

'This morning we witnessed a French government vessel and a French navy warship escort a boat-load of illegal immigrants across the Channel to the midway point where they handed them over to another [Border Force] ship out of Dover.

The numbers crossing the Channel so far this year are the highest on record, beating 2022’s total of 5,828 at the same point by seven per cent.

The surge in crossings comes despite a three-year, £480 million Anglo-French deal, agreed by Rishi Sunak last year, to pay for a doubling in officers patrolling French beaches to 800, a joint command centre and a detention centre to prevent migrants from leaving France.

As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez whines about racism and Republicans, her district is repeatedly invaded by foreign street vendors.

""The NYPD raided an illegal open-air 'flea market' operating in Squad member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s district earlier this week, confiscating counterfeit goods and other items,"" Fox News reported. ""But some sellers have thumbed their noses at law enforcement and are back on the streets peddling their merchandise.""

""The sellers, many of whom are reported to be migrants, have been blocking sidewalks in the Queens neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona, and Elmhurst, shilling various items such as second-hand goods and clothes,"" the media outlet added.

Not only does the ""Squad"" member's constituents feel she has abandoned them, her district no longer even resembles America and residents are fed up over it. Many businesses have closed for good and are leaving over crime, illegal immigrants swarming the area, and the fact that Democrats such as Ocasio-Cortez refuse to do anything about it except make excuses and blame Republicans.

""Local residents say the neighborhood looks like a Third World country due to its shabby-looking and unsanitary-like conditions. Prostitution is also rampant in the area, with some nicknaming the neighborhood’s main strip along Roosevelt Avenue as the 'avenue of the sweethearts,'"" Fox News elaborated.

==================

'New York City Councilwoman Alexa Avilés opened Tuesday’s hearing on the experiences of Black migrants by calling for more funding and language access services for new arrivals from African countries, hundreds of whom gathered at City Hall for the discussion and a rally outside beforehand.'

'Avilés, chair of the City Council’s Committee on Immigration, said that while the city has been offering social and healthcare services to migrants in Spanish and English, it has failed to meet the needs of migrants who speak other languages.'

“Those needing information translated and interpreted in languages predominantly spoken in West African countries, including Wolof, Arabic, Bambara, Fulani and French, among others, have reported difficulty in communicating with migrant shelter staff and obtaining information from city agencies,” she said.

'While the vast majority of asylum seekers and immigrants who’ve entered the shelter system initially came from Latin America, more adult migrants and families are now coming from the African continent.'

She's said that if we don't let illegal aliens commit some crime before being deported, it's a ""police state"". It was in reference to ICE Director @RealTomHoman explaining in 2017 that illegal aliens are fully deportable, and that it's too late for victims if we let them stay in the country long enough to commit acts of violence. In other words, we should deport illegal aliens at the first available opportunity for violating immigration laws. But Ms. Brane doesn't agree, apparently preferring that we let foreigners violate our immigration laws AND commit some assaults, rapes, or homicide before being deported; effectively, she doesn't believe immigration laws are legitimate.

The Washington, D.C. police are allegedly giving a pass to illegal immigrants who are driving motorized bikes around town without license plates, especially those conducting food deliveries.

The Daily Signal did a lengthy writeup after interviewing a number of individuals who admitted they were illegal aliens working as food delivery drivers, utilizing motorcycles or motorized bikes that don't have license plates. That means they are also not registered or insured either.

""D.C. law requires that a motorcycle or a motor-driven cycle, a motor vehicle that has a gas, electric, or hybrid motor no larger than 50 cubic centimeters (cc) and cannot go above 30 mph, be registered with the District’s Department of Motor Vehicles within 30 days of purchase and display a license plate on the back of the two- or three-wheeled vehicle,"" The Daily Signal noted.

""The Daily Signal became aware of an increased number of motor-driven cycles without license plates operating in the District. If operating a motorized bike in the District at speeds above 20 miles per hour, not only does that vehicle require registration, the driver is required to 'have on his or her possession a valid [driver’s] license' and insurance, per the city’s Department of Motor Vehicles,"" the media outlet reported.

There has been an increase in motorized bikes in the nation's capital clogging up the streets. The police seem to be turning a blind eye to them and “do not appear to be enforcing registration laws,” according to the outlet.

Businesses that sell motorized bikes in D.C. claim that the police “don’t give any attention” to the illegal immigrants who are brazenly breaking the law there.

Those businesses are knowingly breaking the law themselves according to The Daily Signal.

California's lax laws left locals in a ""pretty scary"" situation as suspected surf smugglers were spotted offloading illegal aliens.

Mounting safety concerns around the shores of the San Diego area were met with a stunning visual reminder of the current administration's failure to secure the border Saturday. Video taken from the beach in Carlsbad, California, less than an hour north of the city, featured nearly two dozen people hightailing across the shore after a hasty speedboat landing.

""We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they are, and these people were not vetted at all,"" said San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond at a press conference Monday after video of the incident went viral.

"392900","1777114627207536805","What remains unanalysed is always the place of immigrants in the society as proportions of the sub-populations they fill in. And thus no real analysis of displacement.

The 1,000% growth of the Indian population in the US from 1990 (1,200% if you add those in line for a green card) are all overwhelming linked to H1B visa immigration sponging up a huge swathe of the job growth left of America’s dying middle class. Initially in tech, and now all office jobs; even low level universities, journalism & politics now.

Which is why they have a very high average salary & employment rate that is a mirror of the job losses & under-employment of the non-Indian citizens who used to occupy these sectors.

If you measure Indians as a proportion of just the middle or middle-upper class, it’s a massive displacement - which politicians & the media work hard to obscure; successfully as no one walks into the HQs of these companies with a camera or run these numbers.

And then you look at where they end up culturally. In enclaves, cutting deals with existing elites while not integrating into American society. Racially breaking hiring laws with impunity to bring over ever more Indians into these jobs while studiously pushing out Americans. Running political lobbies to make sure their enclaves keep a lock on these jobs & are not prosecuted for racial hiring. Banning Americans on “their” social media platforms. And joining the Woke as a whole new corrupt class with infinite spite for America & Americans; Regarding themselves as the new Global Aristocrats over a declining American populace.

It is but one core tale of economic invasion & complete cultural decline only covered at the margins by just a few journalists or media figures.

There are many more enclaves like this - Across  the West - who will, after we are written out of our own histories, get their own chapters as the deserving conquerors of a witless people.

However, what they don’t know - or don’t have the foresight or insight to even bother with - is that they will all end up just one more tribal faction in a broken post-coalition non-melting-pot.

Many don’t even care, as this was the way of life to begin with, before they migrated. Social & economic brutality, rather than some sort of alien civic altruism, is what they know & they are - incomprehensible to us - more comfortable operating that way.

The Squad Smirks. The H1B CEOs grin blankly as they shut the door on Americans. You sink into a whole host of Tribal Shitholery; far beyond the memories of Western Civilization - Did it even ever exist?

============

The victims in a Bronx shooting that killed one and left the another person clinging to life were Venezuelan nationals, police said Tuesday.

[Both were also illegal aliens. Keep reading.]

Adrian Mendoza, 24, and Jhombeyker Bisbal, 31, were sitting in a 2015 Nissan Rogue outside a McDonald’s on E. 149th St. near Morris Ave. in Mott Haven when a gray Honda Civic pulled up around 4 a.m. Monday.

The passenger of the Civic got out and walked past the victims’ car, but doubled back.

He approached the driver’s side of the car and shot Mendoza in the head and body. The gunman then went to the front of the car and fired numerous shots through the windshield, hitting Bisbal twice in the chest, twice in the arm and twice in the shoulder.

The shooter took off on foot, leaving the critically wounded men in the car.

Medics took Mendoza and Bisbal to nearby Lincoln Hospital, where the younger man died. Bisbal remained in critical condition Tuesday.

Neither man was previously arrested in New York, but in August, Customs and Border Control arrested Mendoza in Texas, Kenny said.

Bisbal was nabbed by the same agency in May.

Police are working to track down the Honda Civic the gunman arrived in, which had Virginia license plates. There were no arrests.

It’s not an easy crossing here—It can take days to get to the “load vehicle” —This group obviously got busted before making it to the road.

The group was transported and will be processed for removal. 

It’s the busy time of year for crossings according to the sheriff. They have been out there responding regularly—He works very closely and relies heavily on BP agents out there as he only has 5 deputies to patrol more than 2300 square miles.

Viral footage of a Texas State Guardsman being caught allegedly smuggling an illegal immigrant across the border is making the rounds.

In a true ""enemy within"" incident, Specialist Savion Amari Donovan Johnson was reportedly busted for batting for the other side, actively and illegally smuggling someone over the border, according to the New York Post.

Police were shocked that a State Guardsman would be involved in human smuggling... Americans, not so much. Johnson was unceremoniously dragged out of the vehicle by members of the Texas Department of Public Safety and Kinney County sheriff’s deputies. Then he was forced to the ground and cuffed on Sunday in Bracketville.

The police chase reached speeds of over 100 mph. Johnson engaged in the chase after turning around at a Border Patrol checkpoint off Highway 674 as officers tried to stop him. Spike strips were eventually deployed to stop the SUV. When the vehicle stopped, the illegal alien bailed and ran before giving himself up to be processed by the Border Patrol.

Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe says the soldier turned around when he approached a pop-up tactical Border Patrol checkpoint off 674 in Kinney County that had only been operational for a few days—The behavior alerting agents who attempted to stop the suv—The sheriff says Texas DPS got involved with the pursuit and used spike strips which ultimately stopped the vehicle.

KCSO assisted in the stop—TX DPS is currently investigating but sources tell me the soldier did not have access to the license plate readers or other technology that would have aided him in his efforts. He was armed so that escalated the smuggling charge. Sources say he was promised $5-6k to transport that one individual.

Marcin Pieciak, 36, had a knife in both hands when he allegedly attacked girlfriend Sarah McNally inside Ceili House in Maspeth Saturday evening. He then turned the knives on himself and was initially listed in critical condition.

He is charged with two counts of weapon possession in addition to murder.

Pieciak and McNally, a native of Longford, Ireland,had been living together in Glendale for about a year.

Pieciak has been arrested for domestic violence before but it wasn’t immediately clear if these attacks involved McNally.

The numbers are of particular concern given that these higher-than-average monthly arrests recently occurred during the winter months.

The winter uptick could spell bigger trouble as the temperatures warm up into spring and summer and make it more practical to cross.

In fiscal 2023, which ran from October 2022 through September 2023, Border Patrol agents apprehended 10,021 people who walked into the country between ports of entry where vehicles and pedestrians are inspected, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.

In the first five months of fiscal 2024, federal agents have caught 6,039 people entering without authorization. The figure puts Border Patrol on track to surpass 14,000 arrests by the end of the year, more than last year’s record.

Border Patrol data are only publicly available dating back to 2007. Over the past 17 years, arrests across the northern border have ranged from 2,200 to 7,900 per year, according to CBP statistics.

A New York Home Depot has deployed a guard dog — and other stores may be close behind — to protect shoppers from aggressive migrants and thieves flooding their parking lots.

Two men wearing MSA Security caps and bulletproof vests with a German Shepherd in tow patrolled the Home Depot in New Rochelle on Tuesday.

The guarded New Rochelle lot was quiet and no migrants loitered there when The Post visited this week, however, seven miles away in Throggs Neck, The Bronx, at least 30 male migrants hovered at the doors of Home Depot.

Some were day laborers simply trying to “shape” for work with local contractors.

But many others aggressively confronted shoppers, trying to sell them phony Apple Airpods or soliciting tips for lifting items from shopping carts into cars — even when uninvited.

“You come out and you’re a woman by yourself, they literally leech onto your wagon, and you’re like ‘No, I don’t need any help,'” one worker said. “And when they’re following you to your car, it’s unnerving.”

She said a female supervisor saw one of the men washing his privates with a water bottle in the lot, and that several women have called customer service to complain that migrants robbed them of purses or phones.

“I came to work one day and there had to be 100 guys out here,” she said. “And I’m like, ‘Oh, my God!'”

A New York Home Depot has deployed a guard dog — and other stores may be close behind — to protect shoppers from aggressive migrants and thieves flooding their parking lots.

Two men wearing MSA Security caps and bulletproof vests with a German Shepherd in tow patrolled the Home Depot in New Rochelle on Tuesday.

The guarded New Rochelle lot was quiet and no migrants loitered there when The Post visited this week, however, seven miles away in Throggs Neck, The Bronx, at least 30 male migrants hovered at the doors of Home Depot.

Some were day laborers simply trying to “shape” for work with local contractors.

But many others aggressively confronted shoppers, trying to sell them phony Apple Airpods or soliciting tips for lifting items from shopping carts into cars — even when uninvited.

“You come out and you’re a woman by yourself, they literally leech onto your wagon, and you’re like ‘No, I don’t need any help,'” one worker said. “And when they’re following you to your car, it’s unnerving.”

She said a female supervisor saw one of the men washing his privates with a water bottle in the lot, and that several women have called customer service to complain that migrants robbed them of purses or phones.

“I came to work one day and there had to be 100 guys out here,” she said. “And I’m like, ‘Oh, my God!'”

Anicet Mayela, 40, a Congolese national, arrived in the UK in 2004 claiming fear of persecution in his home country.

Mayela once protested outside a detention centre with a sign stating 'migrants are not criminals' and could face life in jail for admitting to attacking the teenager.

Mayela is currently in custody and will be sentenced next month.",38,"Thu Apr 18 16:04:20 +0000 2024","1384933637985079299","dave24144975",22488,7003,"Wed Apr 21 18:14:54 +0000 2021",FALSE,"2024-04-18 09:04:20"

'New York City Councilwoman Alexa Avilés opened Tuesday’s hearing on the experiences of Black migrants by calling for more funding and language access services for new arrivals from African countries, hundreds of whom gathered at City Hall for the discussion and a rally outside beforehand.'

'Avilés, chair of the City Council’s Committee on Immigration, said that while the city has been offering social and healthcare services to migrants in Spanish and English, it has failed to meet the needs of migrants who speak other languages.'

“Those needing information translated and interpreted in languages predominantly spoken in West African countries, including Wolof, Arabic, Bambara, Fulani and French, among others, have reported difficulty in communicating with migrant shelter staff and obtaining information from city agencies,” she said.

'While the vast majority of asylum seekers and immigrants who’ve entered the shelter system initially came from Latin America, more adult migrants and families are now coming from the African continent.'
