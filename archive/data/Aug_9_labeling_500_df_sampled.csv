GOP Rockland County Executive Ed Day had warned over the weekend that he already had cops deployed to thwart any incoming migrants sent from the Big Apple — adding, “Mr. Adams, you can try to run us over, [and] I will reach up and grab you by the throat for the people of Rockland County.”

[Orange County Executive Steve] Neuhaus, also a Republican, revealed earlier Tuesday that Adams contacted him last week to say the city was going to pay for about 60 migrants to stay at the Crossroads Hotel in Newburgh in Orange.

Under the counties’ state-of-emergency declarations, hotels, motels and other short-term rentals in the region are prohibited from accepting asylum-seekers bused there.

Newburgh Town Supervisor Gil Piaquadio said Tuesday that town codes already prohibit hotels or motels from being used as shelters there.

“A shelter is not permitted at the Crossroads Hotel,” he said in a statement.

“The Town of Newburgh has a litany of procedures for outside governments to follow when these outside governments, like New York City, propose a use in another jurisdiction. New York City still needs to follow these procedures.”

Marcin Pieciak, 36, had a knife in both hands when he allegedly attacked girlfriend Sarah McNally inside Ceili House in Maspeth Saturday evening. He then turned the knives on himself and was initially listed in critical condition.

He is charged with two counts of weapon possession in addition to murder.

Pieciak and McNally, a native of Longford, Ireland,had been living together in Glendale for about a year.

Pieciak has been arrested for domestic violence before but it wasn’t immediately clear if these attacks involved McNally.

A New York Home Depot has deployed a guard dog — and other stores may be close behind — to protect shoppers from aggressive migrants and thieves flooding their parking lots.

Two men wearing MSA Security caps and bulletproof vests with a German Shepherd in tow patrolled the Home Depot in New Rochelle on Tuesday.

The guarded New Rochelle lot was quiet and no migrants loitered there when The Post visited this week, however, seven miles away in Throggs Neck, The Bronx, at least 30 male migrants hovered at the doors of Home Depot.

Some were day laborers simply trying to “shape” for work with local contractors.

But many others aggressively confronted shoppers, trying to sell them phony Apple Airpods or soliciting tips for lifting items from shopping carts into cars — even when uninvited.

“You come out and you’re a woman by yourself, they literally leech onto your wagon, and you’re like ‘No, I don’t need any help,'” one worker said. “And when they’re following you to your car, it’s unnerving.”

She said a female supervisor saw one of the men washing his privates with a water bottle in the lot, and that several women have called customer service to complain that migrants robbed them of purses or phones.

“I came to work one day and there had to be 100 guys out here,” she said. “And I’m like, ‘Oh, my God!'”

Mounting safety concerns around the shores of the San Diego area were met with a stunning visual reminder of the current administration's failure to secure the border Saturday. Video taken from the beach in Carlsbad, California, less than an hour north of the city, featured nearly two dozen people hightailing across the shore after a hasty speedboat landing.

""We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they are, and these people were not vetted at all,"" said San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond at a press conference Monday after video of the incident went viral.

The Washington, D.C. police are allegedly giving a pass to illegal immigrants who are driving motorized bikes around town without license plates, especially those conducting food deliveries.

The Daily Signal did a lengthy writeup after interviewing a number of individuals who admitted they were illegal aliens working as food delivery drivers, utilizing motorcycles or motorized bikes that don't have license plates. That means they are also not registered or insured either.

""D.C. law requires that a motorcycle or a motor-driven cycle, a motor vehicle that has a gas, electric, or hybrid motor no larger than 50 cubic centimeters (cc) and cannot go above 30 mph, be registered with the District’s Department of Motor Vehicles within 30 days of purchase and display a license plate on the back of the two- or three-wheeled vehicle,"" The Daily Signal noted.

""The Daily Signal became aware of an increased number of motor-driven cycles without license plates operating in the District. If operating a motorized bike in the District at speeds above 20 miles per hour, not only does that vehicle require registration, the driver is required to 'have on his or her possession a valid [driver’s] license' and insurance, per the city’s Department of Motor Vehicles,"" the media outlet reported.

There has been an increase in motorized bikes in the nation's capital clogging up the streets. The police seem to be turning a blind eye to them and “do not appear to be enforcing registration laws,” according to the outlet.

Businesses that sell motorized bikes in D.C. claim that the police “don’t give any attention” to the illegal immigrants who are brazenly breaking the law there.

Those businesses are knowingly breaking the law themselves according to The Daily Signal.

In damning radio messages, the angry senior officer complained to the French coastguard when his vessel, Scot Pioneer, was stopped from entering Dunkirk harbour as navy vessels, including a warship, guided the traffickers' boats around his ship.

In response, the coastguard informed him that there was an 'arrangement' between the London and Paris governments for the French navy to escort migrant boats towards Britain.

The captain begins his protest by radioing the French coastguard with the words: 'I would like to report what is an illegal operation in your waters.

'This morning we witnessed a French government vessel and a French navy warship escort a boat-load of illegal immigrants across the Channel to the midway point where they handed them over to another [Border Force] ship out of Dover.
