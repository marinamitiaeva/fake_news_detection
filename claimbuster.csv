Video taken from the beach in Carlsbad, California, less than an hour north of the city, featured nearly two dozen people hightailing across the shore after a hasty speedboat landing.

""We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they are, and these people were not vetted at all,"" said San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond at a press conference Monday after video of the incident went viral.

The Washington, D.C. police are allegedly giving a pass to illegal immigrants who are driving motorized bikes around town without license plates, especially those conducting food deliveries.

The Daily Signal did a lengthy writeup after interviewing a number of individuals who admitted they were illegal aliens working as food delivery drivers, utilizing motorcycles or motorized bikes that don't have license plates. That means they are also not registered or insured either.

""D.C. law requires that a motorcycle or a motor-driven cycle, a motor vehicle that has a gas, electric, or hybrid motor no larger than 50 cubic centimeters (cc) and cannot go above 30 mph, be registered with the District‚Äôs Department of Motor Vehicles within 30 days of purchase and display a license plate on the back of the two- or three-wheeled vehicle,"" The Daily Signal noted.

""The Daily Signal became aware of an increased number of motor-driven cycles without license plates operating in the District. If operating a motorized bike in the District at speeds above 20 miles per hour, not only does that vehicle require registration, the driver is required to 'have on his or her possession a valid [driver‚Äôs] license' and insurance, per the city‚Äôs Department of Motor Vehicles,"" the media outlet reported.

There has been an increase in motorized bikes in the nation's capital clogging up the streets. The police seem to be turning a blind eye to them and ‚Äúdo not appear to be enforcing registration laws,‚Äù according to the outlet.

Businesses that sell motorized bikes in D.C. claim that the police ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give any attention‚Äù to the illegal immigrants who are brazenly breaking the law there.

Those businesses are knowingly breaking the law themselves according to The Daily Signal.

Under the counties‚Äô state-of-emergency declarations, hotels, motels and other short-term rentals in the region are prohibited from accepting asylum-seekers bused there.

Newburgh Town Supervisor Gil Piaquadio said Tuesday that town codes already prohibit hotels or motels from being used as shelters there.

‚ÄúA shelter is not permitted at the Crossroads Hotel,‚Äù he said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe Town of Newburgh has a litany of procedures for outside governments to follow when these outside governments, like New York City, propose a use in another jurisdiction. New York City still needs to follow these procedures.‚Äù

Two men wearing MSA Security caps and bulletproof vests with a German Shepherd in tow patrolled the Home Depot in New Rochelle on Tuesday.

The guarded New Rochelle lot was quiet and no migrants loitered there when The Post visited this week, however, seven miles away in Throggs Neck, The Bronx, at least 30 male migrants hovered at the doors of Home Depot.

Some were day laborers simply trying to ‚Äúshape‚Äù for work with local contractors.

She said a female supervisor saw one of the men washing his privates with a water bottle in the lot, and that several women have called customer service to complain that migrants robbed them of purses or phones.

The captain of an English cargo ship has accused the French navy of 'illegally trafficking immigrant boats' across the Channel to Dover.

In damning radio messages, the angry senior officer complained to the French coastguard when his vessel, Scot Pioneer, was stopped from entering Dunkirk harbour as navy vessels, including a warship, guided the traffickers' boats around his ship.

In response, the coastguard informed him that there was an 'arrangement' between the London and Paris governments for the French navy to escort migrant boats towards Britain.

The captain begins his protest by radioing the French coastguard with the words: 'I would like to report what is an illegal operation in your waters.

It was in reference to ICE Director @RealTomHoman explaining in 2017 that illegal aliens are fully deportable, and that it's too late for victims if we let them stay in the country long enough to commit acts of violence. In other words, we should deport illegal aliens at the first available opportunity for violating immigration laws.
